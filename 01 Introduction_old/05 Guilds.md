Guilds in Questano are player-formed groups that add a social and cooperative dimension to the platform. A **Guild** is essentially a team or clan of players who band together to complete quests, help each other, and compete collectively. Here’s an in-depth look at guilds:

- **Guild Structure and Roles:** Every guild has a hierarchy:

    - **Guildmaster (Leader):** The player who creates the guild becomes its Guildmaster. They have top administrative privileges – setting the guild’s name, banner, description, and managing members. The Guildmaster can promote/demote members to roles like moderator, and is generally the strategist for guild competitions.
    - **Officers/Moderators:** The Guildmaster can appoint a few trusted members as **Moderators** or Officers. These roles can help accept or invite new members, organize guild quest efforts, and moderate the guild’s chat or forum. They act as lieutenants to the Guildmaster.
    - **Members:** The regular guild members are the majority. They participate in guild activities and contribute points to the guild. All members typically have access to a **guild chat** (maybe a private Discord channel or an in-app chat) and possibly a **guild bank** (if implemented for sharing items).
    - (Optional roles: some guilds may have specialized roles like “Quest Coordinator” or “Recruiter” with limited permissions, depending on features.)

- **Guild Creation Requirements:** To prevent spam guilds and ensure commitment, creating a guild has some prerequisites:

    - **Cost:** There may be a Gold (USDM) fee or an ADA fee to create a guild (e.g. **50 Gold** or an equivalent ADA amount). This sink discourages frivolous guild creation and also serves as a Gold burn in the economy.
    - **XP Level:** The founder might need to be at least a certain level (e.g. Level 5) to prove they have experience in Questano.
    - **Members:** Alternatively or additionally, creating a guild might require a minimum of say 5 founding members (who agree to join at creation). This ensures new guilds start with a team, not a lone person.
    - **Verification:** Guild names could be subject to approval or filters to avoid duplicates or inappropriate names. Some guilds might be official (like a well-known community setting up a guild can get a verified checkmark).

- **Guild Size:** Guilds can start with a certain maximum member count (say 20 members). This cap could be raised by guild achievements or spending Gold to upgrade guild capacity. The cap ensures competition remains fair (one guild can’t have everyone) and incentivizes multiple guilds rather than one mega-guild.

- **Guild Quests & Activities:** Guilds unlock special content:

    - **Guild Quests:** These are quests that require multiple guild members to participate. For example, “Guild Boss Battle – at least 10 members must individually complete a certain quest for the guild to succeed”. Upon success, every participant (or all guild members) get a reward, and the guild earns Guild Points or reputation.
    - **Guild Challenges:** There might be weekly guild challenges like “Accumulate 5000 points collectively this week” – if achieved, all members get a bonus (and possibly the guild climbs rankings).
    - **Collaboration:** Even outside formal “guild quests”, guild members naturally can coordinate to complete normal quests. They might strategize: e.g., dividing tasks or helping each other (like sharing tips or even lending items).

- **Guild Points and Leaderboard:** Guilds have an associated score, often just the sum of all Points earned by their members during the season (possibly with some weighting or limit per member to avoid huge guilds dominating). This creates the **Guild Leaderboard**, where guilds compete. Some seasons might also introduce guild-vs-guild competitions (like a bracket or cumulative event).

    - **Competition Dynamics:** Guild rivalry can be strong. Smaller guilds might aim for high average points per member, while larger guilds rely on sheer volume. Questano could level this by dividing by guild size or having tiers of guild competition (small vs small, large vs large). It’s important to ensure a guild of 5 hardcore players can still beat a guild of 20 casual players if they perform better.
    - Guild competitions could include specific events like a “Guild Tournament” quest – e.g. a scavenger hunt where the first guild to have all members find a clue wins.

- **Guild Rewards:** At season’s end, top guilds receive recognition and rewards. This could be:

    - **Trophies:** An NFT trophy for the guild (displayed on guild page, maybe tradable among members or just a badge).
    - **Gold/Items:** A pot of Gold or items that either go into a guild bank or are distributed equally to members. The guild master or system can decide distribution.
    - **Guild Fame:** Perhaps guilds as entities can also have a reputation level (especially if guilds ally with factions). Top guild might get a shoutout from project partners or special privileges.
    - Unique perks like the #1 guild could design a quest or have their guild logo displayed in the Questano Hall of Fame.

- **Guild Communication:** Questano likely integrates with Discord or has in-app guild chat features. A guild needs a way to communicate: sharing quest tips, coordinating login times for group events, etc. Many will likely use external channels (Discord, Telegram), so Questano might provide Discord bot integration – e.g., a bot that tracks guild points in real-time in their server.

- **Moderation & Conduct:** Guildmasters and moderators are expected to uphold community guidelines within their guild. Questano provides moderation tools (kick/ban member from guild, report guild for misconduct). If a guild is found cheating (e.g., colluding to exploit something) or harassing others, there are penalties (deducting points or disqualifying the guild). Thankfully, having a **structured guild leadership** usually helps self-police issues.


**In summary, guilds turn Questano into a team game.** They promote camaraderie and strategy: a solo player can only do so much, but a coordinated guild can dominate leaderboards. This is similar to “clans” or “alliances” in many online games, and it harnesses social motivation. Many Cardano community members naturally form groups (like stake pool communities, Discord groups); Questano gives them an in-game identity and goal. Competing as a guild also means new players can get help – joining a guild might come with mentorship by veterans.

Finally, guilds can also interface with factions: for instance, a guild might declare a **primary faction alignment** (like an e-sports team picking a sponsor). A guild could earn extra fame for their chosen faction by collectively completing those quests. This can tie together the guild and faction systems in interesting ways.
