Quests are the heart of Questano. They are **tasks or challenges** that players undertake to earn rewards (Points, XP, Gold, etc., as described above). Questano offers a variety of quest types to cater to different interests and to meet the needs of partner projects. Each quest is categorized by type, difficulty, and rewards. Below are the main quest types, with detailed examples and typical rewards:

- **Daily Quests:** Simple, repeatable tasks that encourage players to log in regularly. _Examples:_ “Check-in to Questano (click a button once a day)” – rewards 5 XP, 5 Points; “Upvote a helpful post in the community forum” – rewards 5 Points, 1 Fame for a random faction you support. **Rewards:** Low (small XP/Point rewards, maybe 0.1 Gold). **Purpose:** drive daily engagement and habit formation.

- **Social Media Quests:** Tasks involving social platforms to spread the word or engage with content. _Examples:_ “Tweet about your favorite Cardano project with #Questano” (submit your tweet link as proof) – rewards 10 XP, 10 Points, 2 Fame for that project; “Join Project X’s Telegram and post your Questano username” – rewards 5 Fame with Project X, maybe an NFT badge if it’s a campaign. **Rewards:** Low to medium (Fame-heavy rewards, some points; occasionally an NFT for promotional campaigns). **Purpose:** marketing for partners and community building.

- **Educational Quests:** Learn-and-earn style tasks to educate users about Cardano or specific dApps. _Examples:_ “Complete the Cardano Basics Quiz” (a quiz about Cardano history or tech) – rewards 20 XP, 15 Points, perhaps a small ADA reward or NFT certificate; “Read an article about Project Y and answer 3 questions” – rewards Fame for Project Y and XP. **Rewards:** Medium (XP and Fame focus, maybe a tiny Gold for lengthy tasks). **Purpose:** onboard new users, increase knowledge in a fun way.

- **On-Chain Action Quests:** Quests that require interacting with Cardano blockchain or dApps. Questano verifies these via on-chain data. _Examples:_ “Perform a swap on Minswap DEX” – Questano checks if your wallet did a swap on that platform during the quest period, then rewards 50 Points, 30 XP, plus some **Minswap tokens** as bonus ; “Mint an NFT on XYZ Minting dApp” – rewards an exclusive NFT and Fame with that project. **Rewards:** Medium to High (these often give good Points and sometimes partner tokens). **Purpose:** drive usage of Cardano dApps, familiarizing users with ecosystem tools.

- **Community Quests (Guild Quests):** Tasks that involve community collaboration or guild members working together. _Examples:_ “Guild Donation Drive – contribute at least 10 ADA to a charity pool” – if X% of guild members do it, each gets 100 Points and the guild gets a big Fame boost; “Refer a friend to Questano” – once your referral completes tutorial quests, you both get 20 XP and 20 Points (referral quests encourage growth). **Rewards:** Variable; often these have collective rewards (guild gets Points collectively, etc.). **Purpose:** strengthen guild bonds, encourage inviting new users.

- **Faction-Specific Quests:** Created by partner projects (factions) to engage their supporters. _Examples:_ “Use Project Z’s app and provide feedback” – users might have to try a feature on Project Z’s platform and submit a feedback form; reward: 40 Fame (Project Z), 20 Points, maybe a **Project Z token airdrop**. Another example: “Design a meme about Project Z” – community vote the best, winners get special NFT from Project Z. **Rewards:** Can be high Fame and unique items from the project. **Purpose:** deep engagement with that project’s community.

- **Weekly/Seasonal Quests:** Larger quests that can be completed once a week or once per season. They often have multiple steps. _Examples:_ “Weekly Challenge: Complete any 5 on-chain quests this week” – upon completing 5, you get a bonus 100 Points and 10 Gold; “Season Quest: Try 10 different dApps in the Cardano ecosystem” – over the season, tick off a list of 10 distinct partner quests to earn a **Season Explorer NFT** plus a chunk of Points. **Rewards:** High (these are lengthy, so they give significant Points/XP/Gold, and often a special NFT or title). **Purpose:** encourage sustained effort and exploring breadth of content.

- **Puzzle or Treasure Hunt Quests:** Fun, riddles, or ARGs (Alternate Reality Games). _Examples:_ “Solve the Riddle of Satoshi’s Treasure” – a multi-part puzzle quest possibly spread across websites or even real locations, first X solvers get a **Legendary Treasure NFT** and lots of Points; “Easter Egg Hunt during Cardano Summit” – find codes in conference livestreams or virtual spaces and submit them. **Rewards:** High for winners (unique NFTs, large Gold prizes), but only a few complete it. **Purpose:** create buzz and deeper engagement, often timed with events.

- **Competitive Event Quests:** Special quests that pit players against each other or against a benchmark. _Examples:_ “Trading Competition: achieve the highest ROI trading on a Cardano DEX with a test amount” – players are ranked by some metric; top ranks get big rewards; “PvP Quiz Tournament” – live trivia where top scorers earn Points and NFTs. **Rewards:** High for top performers (Points, Gold, NFT trophies). **Purpose:** spikes of activity and excitement, often tied to an event calendar.

- **Moderation and Content Quests:** Quests that involve contributing content or moderation. _Examples:_ “Write a blog post about your Questano journey” – if approved, earn 50 Points, an Author badge NFT; “Help answer questions in the newbie channel (at least 3 quality answers)” – rewards 30 XP, 10 Points, maybe a **Moderator fame** (if Questano has an internal rep for helpers). **Rewards:** Mostly XP/Fame, possibly special roles. **Purpose:** improve community content and self-help.

Each quest type clearly specifies its requirements and what proof is needed (Questano provides a UI to submit proof, or reads blockchain data, or uses APIs for Twitter/Discord to verify actions). Quests can combine types as well – for example, a **faction weekly quest** might require both an on-chain action and a social post about it.

It’s important to note that Questano’s quest architecture is flexible: **partners can create custom quests** to fit their campaign (with admin approval). The above list covers the typical categories, ensuring a **mix of online/offline, easy/hard, individual/team** activities. This variety keeps players from getting bored and allows everyone to find quests that suit their play style (be it social media savvy, tech savvy, competitive, or casual).

_For instance, a single Cardano project might run a campaign comprising multiple quest types: a quiz (educational), a usage task (on-chain), and a social share – thereby maximizing community engagement. Platforms like QuestN and Zealy have shown the effectiveness of offering both on-chain and off-chain tasks to engage users_ _._ Questano builds on that concept within the Cardano ecosystem.

Each quest lists its **rewards upfront**, so players can prioritize. Some chase points to climb leaderboards, others might chase specific NFTs or tokens they want. By completing a diverse range of quests, players naturally participate in **many aspects of Cardano’s ecosystem**, learning and earning as they go.
