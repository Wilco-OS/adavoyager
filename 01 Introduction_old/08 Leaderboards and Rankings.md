Competition in Questano comes to life through its comprehensive **leaderboards**. The platform maintains multiple leaderboards to cater to individual, group, and community comparisons, as well as different time frames. Here are the key leaderboards and how they work:

### **User Leaderboards**

**User (Player) Leaderboards** rank individual players by their Points or other metrics. Questano typically provides several time-based views:

- **Weekly Leaderboard:** Resets every week (e.g., Monday to Sunday). Shows which players earned the most Points in that week. This gives short-term goals and lets newcomers shine even if they joined late in the season. Often small rewards or recognition can be given to weekly top performers (like 1st place gets a little Gold or an NFT badge for “Weekly Winner”).

- **Seasonal Leaderboard:** This is the big one for competition – it tracks total Points for the current season. It usually appears on the main dashboard, with top 100 (or more) players listed. At season’s end, these rankings determine major prizes. **Example:** If you rank #1 at season end, you might earn a Legendary NFT + large token reward; ranks 2-10 also get major prizes, etc. This leaderboard resets each season after prizes are awarded.

- **All-Time Leaderboard:** A cumulative scoreboard of Points (or perhaps XP could be used for all-time, since points reset). This shows the “Hall of Fame” of Questano – those who have been consistently top performers over the life of the platform. It’s more about prestige than rewards; maybe an occasional lifetime achievement reward can be given. All-time Points could simply sum up points from all seasons, or count number of times someone finished top X, etc.

- **By Metric:** There might be leaderboards for other specific metrics:
    
    - **XP Leaderboard:** Who has the highest XP (levels)? This correlates with most active over time.
    - **Gold Rich List:** Who has accumulated the most Gold currency (though if people spend Gold, this might fluctuate).
    - **Fame Leaderboard:** Possibly per faction, who has the top fame for each faction (this could be on faction pages rather than main leaderboards).

These leaderboards drive players to keep pushing. The weekly gives quick wins, seasonal gives the main competitive thrust, and all-time tracks legacy. The UI likely lets you toggle between them.

### **Guild Leaderboard**

The **Guild Leaderboard** ranks all guilds based on the total Points contributed by their members (usually for the season, since guild competition is also seasonal). It shows guild name, total points, and possibly the number of members (and maybe average per member to gauge efficiency). This fosters guild rivalries and cooperation:

- It updates continuously as members complete quests.
- It may have divisions or categories if needed (if some guilds are much larger, perhaps separate bracket).
- Rewards: At season end, top guilds get prizes as mentioned (Gold or item distributions). Additionally, recognition like a “Guild Champion” badge for members of the #1 guild, etc. might be given.
- There might also be a **weekly guild leaderboard** for fun, but guilds are usually more long-term. Perhaps events might have short guild rankings too (e.g., “this event which guild contributed the most”).
- This leaderboard encourages guild recruitment and strategy – guild masters will motivate their members to do more quests for collective glory.

### **Faction Leaderboard**

The **Faction Leaderboard** is a bit different: it’s not player-organized but project-organized. It ranks the Factions (Cardano projects) by their community engagement on Questano:

- Likely metric: total Fame gained by all users of that faction during the season (or total Points from that faction’s quests). Both correlate with “how active is that faction’s community.”
- This shows, for example, “Faction A’s supporters earned 50,000 fame this season, Faction B’s earned 40,000,” etc.
- It’s more for insight and maybe friendly competition among project communities (“Let’s beat Project X as the most active community!”).
- **Use Cases:** If a new project joins and skyrockets to #1 faction, it shows they have momentum. Or if an established project sees low faction rank, it might encourage them to create more quests or rally their base.
- Rewards: There could be some inter-faction competitions where a winning faction (the project team) might get a special NFT trophy or just bragging rights. More importantly, the top supporters within that faction get rewards from the project. For instance, Project A might promise that if they top the faction leaderboard, they’ll airdrop an extra token bonus to all participants who helped (this would be a partner-driven incentive).
- This board resets periodically (likely each season too) to reflect current activity. There could also be an all-time faction board just showing overall which project has had the most engagement through Questano in total.

### **Event Leaderboards**

For special events or mini-games within Questano, temporary leaderboards can be spun up:

- **Example:** If there’s a month-long “Cardano Summit Quest Series,” there might be an event-specific leaderboard tracking just points from those event quests. Winners get event-specific prizes.
- These leaderboards exist for the duration of the event and might be separate from the main season points (or could contribute to it as well).
- Having event leaderboards allows Questano to host **mini competitions** that are more focused or thematic, without disturbing the main progression too much.

### **Display and Updates**

The leaderboards are typically accessible from a “Rankings” or “Leaderboards” section in the UI. They update in near real-time, motivating players as they see their name climb or fall. Players can likely filter/search for their name to see their current rank (“You are #125 – keep going to reach the top 100!”). This feedback loop drives engagement.

### **Anti-Cheating on Leaderboards**

Questano will implement anti-cheating measures to ensure the leaderboards are fair. Any detection of bot activity or exploit that artificially boosts points could lead to removal of those points or disqualification of the player/guild. (We’ll discuss anti-sybil more later, but it’s relevant here to maintain leaderboard integrity.)

### **Historical Seasons**

It’s common to have an archive of past season results: each season’s top 10 players, top guild, and top faction might be recorded in a “Hall of Fame” page. This gives long-term recognition. For example, “Season 3 Champion: Alice (Guild XYZ), Season 3 Top Guild: Dragon Riders, Season 3 Faction MVP: Minswap Community.” This historical context adds depth and prestige – players strive not only to win, but to be remembered.

In essence, the multi-faceted leaderboards create **ongoing competition at different scales**:

- Solo players against each other.
- Guilds as teams against other teams.
- Factions (communities) in a soft competition of engagement.
- Short-term sprints (weekly, events) and long-term marathons (seasonal, all-time).

This layered approach keeps everyone engaged: even if you can’t be #1 overall, maybe your guild can be #1, or maybe you can win one week, or at least be the top in your faction, etc. There are many ways to excel and be recognized. Leaderboards tap into the human love of competition and recognition, which is a big part of the gamification that Questano brings to Cardano community participation.
