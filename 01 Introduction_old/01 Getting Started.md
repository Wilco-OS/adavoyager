New users can start their Questano journey in just a few steps. **Onboarding** has been designed to be simple even for those new to blockchain:

1. **Accessing Questano:** Visit the Questano web app (or mobile app, if available) and click **“Connect Wallet”**. Questano uses Cardano’s web3 wallets (e.g. Nami, Eternl, Flint) for login. Your wallet address will serve as your account – no separate username/password needed. By connecting a Cardano web wallet, you’ll enable Questano to read your NFTs and tokens (with your permission) and to send you rewards .

2. **Profile Setup & NFT Avatars:** Once connected, you can set up your profile. Choose a username (this can be a pseudonym or your ADA handle) and select an avatar. **Avatars** in Questano are represented by NFTs – you can use one of your existing Cardano NFT profile pics/characters or obtain a Questano-specific avatar NFT. New players without NFTs can pick from a set of default avatars or a free avatar NFT provided during onboarding. Avatars are cosmetic but play a role in the **full game version** (see below). They are stored in your wallet and displayed on your profile, showcasing true ownership (just as Cardano games like AdaQuest use NFTs to represent in-game assets that players own ).

3. **Choosing Free vs. Full Game:** Questano offers a **Free Play** mode and a **Full Game** mode:

    - **Free Version:** The free version lets anyone complete basic quests and participate in events without any upfront cost. As a free player, you can still earn **experience points (XP)** and a small amount of in-game currency (Gold), and appear on leaderboards. However, free accounts have some limitations: for example, they might earn rewards at a reduced rate (e.g. only a fraction of points or no token rewards), and certain high-tier quests or NFT item rewards might be inaccessible. Free players get a taste of the Questano experience with minimal commitment.

    - **Full Version (NFT Pass):** To unlock the full game benefits, a user must acquire a Questano **Avatar NFT** (or another form of premium pass). Owning this NFT and linking it to your account upgrades you to the full version. Full players have access to the complete range of quests (including exclusive quests with bigger prizes), can earn **full rewards** (all Gold/USDM payouts, NFTs, etc.), and enjoy progression beyond certain caps. They may also get bonus multipliers on points or XP. The NFT avatar acts like a membership token – it also provides additional cosmetic options and perhaps unique abilities in quests. _Example:_ A full player might earn 100% of the Gold reward from a quest whereas a free player earns only 50%. This system ensures **everyone can play for free**, while those who invest in the platform via an NFT get proportional benefits.

4. **Tutorial Quests:** After profile setup, beginners are guided through a short tutorial quest chain. This onboarding quest might include tasks like “Join the Questano Discord”, “Follow Questano on social media”, “Complete your profile info”, or a simple on-chain action (for example, receive a _welcome NFT_ or make a token transaction on a testnet). By completing the tutorial, users learn how to use the interface and are rewarded with a bit of XP and Gold – and perhaps a **starter item** (like a badge NFT indicating “Season 1 Adventurer”). This lowers the learning curve and gets players immediately involved in the fun.


Wallet connection is secure – **Questano never controls your funds or keys.** It only requests viewing access and transaction signing for specific actions (e.g. claiming a reward). Users can disconnect at any time. By leveraging Cardano wallets for login and item storage, Questano ensures a **decentralized identity** for players and direct ownership of game assets. Onboarding is thus quick, **non-custodial**, and user-friendly.
