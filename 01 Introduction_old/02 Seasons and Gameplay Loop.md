Questano operates on a **seasonal gameplay model** to keep the experience fresh and competitive over time. A **Season** is a fixed period (for example, a quarter or a month) during which players embark on quests, accumulate points, and vie for the top spots. 
Here’s how the seasonal loop works:

- **Season Launch:** At the start of a season, a new theme or set of featured quests is introduced. All players’ **Seasonal Points** are reset to zero (other permanent stats like XP and Gold remain). New content may be added – for instance, partnership with new Cardano projects bring new Factions and quest lines into the game for that season. A season could have a narrative theme (e.g. “Journey to the Catalyst Peaks” featuring governance-related quests) to add flavor.

- **Questing Phase:** Throughout the season, players complete various quests to earn **Points** (the seasonal competition metric) along with other rewards (XP, Gold, items, etc. detailed in the Economy section). The gameplay loop revolves around doing quests daily/weekly, joining guild activities, and participating in special events. Players climb the **leaderboards** as they accumulate Points. This phase encourages regular engagement: for example, daily quests encourage logging in each day, weekly quests offer bigger challenges, and special event quests might appear for limited times.

- **Competitive Dynamics:** During the season, friendly competition builds up:

    - **Player vs Player:** Individual players try to maximize their Points to rank high on the **User Leaderboard**. Rivalries can form as they see their ranking relative to others.

    - **Guild vs Guild:** Guilds compete on the **Guild Leaderboard** by pooling member points or completing group quests. This fosters teamwork within guilds.

    - **Faction Support:** Factions (representing Cardano projects) also effectively compete indirectly – as players earn Fame and points for their favorite projects, the **Faction Leaderboard** shows which project communities are most active.

- **Mid-Season Events:** To keep things interesting, Questano may introduce mid-season events or challenges. For example, a week-long event could boost points for certain quest types (“DeFi Week: extra points for DEX-related quests”) or introduce a cooperative raid quest where the community must reach a collective goal. Such events not only add variety but also allow **late-joining players** to catch up by earning bonus points.

- **Season Finale & Rewards:** When the season’s timeframe concludes, final tallies are taken. This is the climax of competition:

    - The top players on the **User Leaderboard** earn prestigious rewards (examples: limited-edition NFT trophies, large pools of Gold/USDM, partner tokens, or even ADA prizes if sponsored). Often, **only a small percentage of players receive the very highest prizes**, emphasizing the prestige of ranking high.

    - Guild rankings are finalized – the top guild might earn collective rewards (e.g. a special badge for all members or a share of a reward pool) and recognition in the Hall of Fame.

    - Faction standings are also announced – for instance, the project whose supporters earned the most total points might be crowned “Faction Champion” of the season, which is great publicity for that project.

    - Additionally, **tiered rewards** can ensure many participants get something: for example, maybe all players who reached a certain point threshold get a reward (like a “Season 1 Survivor” NFT or some tokens). This encourages broad participation, not just for the top 10. _Competitive blockchain games often use such seasonal models; for instance, Machiavellic – a Cardano MMO – runs in seasons where players accumulate resources and rewards until the season ends_ _, and top competitors earn rare NFT prizes_ _._

- **Off-Season & Reset:** After a season finale, there might be a short off-season (a break) during which no new points are earned. This is a time for distributing rewards and perhaps running community votes/feedback. Players can prepare for the next season (guilds recruiting new members, projects joining as new factions, etc.). Crucially, at season end, **Seasonal Points reset** for everyone to level the playing field for the next round. However, other long-term stats like XP, Gold, and Fame usually persist (or at least Fame persists, as it’s cumulative reputation). This means veteran players carry over their experience and rewards, but each season everyone has an equal shot at the top of the point leaderboard.

The seasonal approach ensures that **no one rests on their laurels**. Even if you join late or miss one season, you can still compete fresh in the next. It also aligns with Cardano’s fast-moving ecosystem – new projects and features can be introduced each season to keep content updated. By cycling through seasons, Questano maintains ongoing excitement and recurring engagement rather than a one-and-done experience. Each season tells a new chapter in the Questano saga, and players eagerly anticipate what’s next.
