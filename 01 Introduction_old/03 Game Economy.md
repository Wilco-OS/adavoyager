Questano‚Äôs economy is built around multiple interconnected components that track progress and reward players. Understanding each of these **economy components** is key to mastering the game:
### **Experience (XP)**

**Experience Points (XP)** measure a player‚Äôs overall progression and level in Questano. Every time you complete quests, you earn XP in addition to other rewards. XP accumulates **permanently across seasons** (it does not reset) and contributes to your **player level**:

- **Leveling Up:** As you reach XP thresholds, your profile ‚Äúlevels up‚Äù (e.g. Level 2 at 100 XP, Level 3 at 300 XP, and so on; the exact curve can be adjusted for pacing). Leveling up might grant small bonuses, such as a one-time Gold reward or unlocking a new avatar border or title. It‚Äôs primarily a reflection of your experience on the platform.

- **Skill & Trust Indicator:** A high level indicates a veteran player who has been consistently active. This can build **trust and reputation**; for instance, internal moderators might pay more attention to reports from a high-level user, or guilds might recruit based on level as evidence of commitment.

- **Use of XP:** While XP itself is not spent, it could unlock features. For example, certain quests or guild leadership roles might require a minimum level. Also, XP could factor into **role tiers** (see User Roles section) ‚Äì e.g. you become a ‚ÄúSenior Adventurer‚Äù at level 10, which might come with a badge and slight advantages. XP ensures that even if you don‚Äôt top the leaderboards, your consistent play is rewarded with progression.

- **Earning XP:** Most quests give XP proportional to their difficulty/length. A simple social media task might give 5 XP, whereas a complex on-chain quest or attending an event might give 50 XP. There may also be ways to get bonus XP, like streak bonuses for daily logins or referral bonuses for inviting new users.

In summary, XP is your **long-term growth metric** in Questano, showcasing your journey and dedication. It‚Äôs akin to a player‚Äôs level in an RPG ‚Äì always rising as you adventure more, and never lost.

### **Gold (USDM)**

**Gold** is Questano‚Äôs primary in-game currency, used for transactions and rewards within the platform. Gold is denominated in **USDM**, which is a fiat-backed stablecoin on Cardano (pegged 1:1 to the US dollar ). By using a stablecoin as the basis for Gold, Questano ensures the value of rewards and prices remains stable over time (1 Gold ‚âà $1 USD in value). Here‚Äôs how Gold works:

- **Earning Gold:** Players earn Gold by completing quests (especially certain quests marked with a Gold reward), winning events, or as seasonal prizes. For example, a medium-difficulty quest might reward 0.5 Gold, while a major tournament or end-of-season reward could grant 50 Gold. Gold may also be given for **achievements** (e.g. reaching a certain fame level or leveling up might come with a few Gold as a gift).

- **Spending Gold:** Gold can be spent within Questano‚Äôs marketplace or features. Uses include:

    - Purchasing **items or consumables** in an in-game shop (e.g. buying a loot box NFT, or a power-up that boosts your quest rewards for an hour, etc.).
    - Buying **cosmetic upgrades** for your avatar or guild emblem (like new skins, backgrounds ‚Äì perhaps sold as NFTs).
    - Paying **entry fees** for special quests or tournaments. For instance, a tournament quest might require a 2 Gold entry fee that goes into the prize pool.
    - Trading with other players: Gold could potentially be used in a player-to-player market to buy/trade NFT items or services (if enabled).


- **Currency Form:** Since Gold is essentially USDM stablecoin under the hood, it‚Äôs an actual Cardano native token with real value (USDM tokens are backed 1:1 by USD reserves ). This means when players earn Gold, they could withdraw it from the platform to a personal wallet as USDM, or Questano might allow converting it to ADA or other tokens via integrated DEX if desired. However, to encourage reinvesting in gameplay, small withdrawal fees or minimum thresholds might apply.

- **Balancing and Fairness:** Because Gold has real value, Questano will carefully balance Gold rewards to prevent abuse. The **anti-sybil measures** (discussed later) are crucial here ‚Äì we don‚Äôt want bots farming Gold. Also, free players might have a cap on how much Gold they can earn per season to prevent infinite farming with multiple free accounts. The presence of Gold makes Questano a **play-to-earn** experience in moderation, but the focus is on fun and engagement rather than purely monetary gain.

- **USDM Stability:** Using USDM (instead of a volatile token) means the ‚ÄúGold‚Äù value doesn‚Äôt fluctuate wildly with crypto markets. This reliability encourages both players and partners ‚Äì players know what a reward is roughly worth in fiat terms, and partners can budget campaign rewards more predictably. (USDM is a newer Cardano stablecoin launched in 2024 that is fully fiat-backed .)

In essence, Gold (USDM) is the **economic glue** of Questano ‚Äì it rewards players with something of stable value and provides a currency to power the in-game economy.

### **Fame (Reputation)**

**Fame** represents a player‚Äôs reputation and support within specific **Factions** (projects or communities on Cardano). Unlike XP (which is global), Fame is **project-specific reputation**. Each partner project that joins Questano as a Faction has its own Fame metric for players:

- **Fame per Faction:** If there are, say, 10 partner projects on the platform (Project A, Project B, etc.), each player will have a Fame score with Project A, a separate Fame score with Project B, and so on. You earn Fame with a given faction by doing quests that support or relate to that project. For example, if **Minswap DEX** is a faction and you complete a quest like ‚ÄúProvide liquidity on Minswap‚Äù, you gain Minswap Fame points.

- **Earning Fame:** Faction quests clearly indicate how much Fame they award. Additionally, some general quests might let you choose which faction to pledge the points toward (for instance, a generic ‚ÄúCardano trivia quiz‚Äù quest might let you choose your favorite project to gain Fame with). **Supporter actions** like tweeting about the project, attending their AMA, or using their product are typical Fame-earning tasks. Fame might also be obtainable by holding the project‚Äôs token or NFT (proving you are a supporter) ‚Äì e.g. Questano could grant a one-time Fame boost for verifying you hold at least 100 of Project X‚Äôs tokens.

- **Fame Levels & Titles:** Each faction can define **supporter levels** based on Fame thresholds. As your Fame increases, you progress through tiers such as _Fan ‚Üí Advocate ‚Üí Champion_ (or custom names per project). For example: 0-99 Fame = ‚ÄúNovice Supporter‚Äù, 100-499 = ‚ÄúDedicated Supporter‚Äù, 500+ = ‚ÄúElite Ambassador‚Äù (just as an illustration). These levels might come with **badges or titles** visible on your profile (e.g. ‚Äúüåü Project A Champion‚Äù). They indicate your standing in that community.

- **Benefits of Fame:** Fame is primarily a bragging right and a way to signal your loyalty to a project. However, Questano builds in **multiplier benefits**: higher fame level might grant a multiplier on points or Gold when doing quests _for that faction_. For instance, if you are a top-tier supporter of Project A, you might earn +10% points on any Project A quests you complete, as a thank-you for being a superfan. Additionally, projects could offer **external perks** to high-fame users: e.g. early access to their app features, whitelist spots for NFT drops, governance roles in their community, etc. Questano facilitates this by sharing a list of top supporters with the project (with user consent). _This approach turns community reputation into a measurable metric. Similar reputation systems exist in blockchain communities to reward genuine supporters (for example, some platforms use on-chain reputation or NFT badges for community contributors)._

- **Persistence:** Fame does **not reset each season**. Your reputation with a project carries over indefinitely (though projects might have special seasonal fame events or leaderboards). This encourages long-term alignment: if you truly like a project, you‚Äôll build up a high Fame over time. However, to keep things lively, there could be **Faction Leaderboards per season** measuring how much fame people earned _during that season_ for each faction, with perhaps small seasonal prizes. But the cumulative total remains as a legacy score.

In summary, Fame is all about **affiliation and loyalty**. It‚Äôs the measure of how much you‚Äôve contributed to and supported each project. By gamifying community support, Questano gives projects a way to identify and appreciate their top advocates, and gives players a way to showcase their favorite causes.

### **Points (Seasonal Points)**

**Points** are the core competitive metric in Questano, used to track progress within a season. Unlike XP or Fame, Points are **season-specific and reset after each season**. Key features of Points:

- **Earning Points:** Virtually all quests award Points upon completion. The amount can vary: simple quests might give 10 points, while very difficult or long-term quests could give hundreds. Points might also be referred to as ‚ÄúQuest Points‚Äù or just ‚ÄúScore‚Äù. They are the primary unit for leaderboard rankings (both individual and guild ‚Äì usually by summing member points).

- **Purpose of Points:** Points have one main purpose: to measure competition for that season. They determine your ranking on the **User Leaderboard** (and contribute to guild/faction rankings). While you do earn other rewards from quests (XP, Gold, etc.), Points are specifically for comparing against others. They don‚Äôt carry real monetary value directly, but they lead to **season rewards** based on your rank or point milestones.

- **Point Scaling and Balance:** Questano‚Äôs point system is carefully balanced so that no single quest yields an insurmountable lead. Often, point rewards might be scaled such that **diminishing returns** apply if someone tries to grind low-level quests repeatedly (to prevent exploits). For example, repeatable quests could give slightly fewer points after the first completion in a day. Competitive events might have high points but limited frequency (so it‚Äôs fair for all). Additionally, **point multipliers** from roles or fame (see User Roles section) can affect how many points _you_ get from a quest, but for fairness, the leaderboards consider base points (or everyone has equal chance to earn multipliers through effort).

- **Spending or Using Points:** Generally, you do not ‚Äúspend‚Äù Points ‚Äì they are not a currency but a score. However, some gamified systems allow conversion of excess points to minor rewards at season‚Äôs end (e.g. if you‚Äôre not in top ranks, you might redeem points for consolation prizes). Questano might implement a **Point Store** at season end: for instance, if you have over 1000 points, you can trade 100 points for a small Gold or item reward. This ensures even non-winners get utility from points, though the top performers would naturally prefer their leaderboard prizes.

- **Season Reset:** When a new season starts, all players‚Äô point totals go to zero, leveling the field. Past point achievements might be recorded in a profile history (‚ÄúSeason 2: 3,450 points, Rank #15‚Äù), but they no longer count towards active competition. This reset prevents rich-get-richer dynamics and aligns with the seasonal design (everyone gets a fresh start). It‚Äôs worth noting that using a **seasonal points system** is common in competitive games to periodically refresh competition .

- **Point Events:** Sometimes Questano might hold short-term contests where points earned in a specific week or event count separately (like an ‚ÄúEvent Leaderboard‚Äù). These are like mini-seasons inside a season. But ultimately, the season total is the primary focus.

In essence, Points are your **score** for the season. Gather as many as possible before the clock runs out! They fuel the competitive spirit and ensure that every quest completed gets you closer to glory (and rewards) in the current season.

### **Items (NFTs, Tokens, and Merch)**

Questano features a variety of **items** that players can earn or collect, adding depth to the economy. These items come in several forms:

- **NFT Items:** Many rewards in Questano are **non-fungible tokens (NFTs)** on Cardano. These could include:

    - **Avatar NFTs:** As discussed, players can own avatar character NFTs. Some may be purely cosmetic, while others (especially limited ones) might confer bonus perks in-game (for example, a special avatar might grant +5% XP gain due to its lore).
    - **Equipment/Consumables:** Questano might introduce game-like items such as **potions, tools, badges** that exist as NFTs in your inventory. A potion could be an NFT that, when ‚Äúused‚Äù (burned or locked by the platform), gives you a temporary boost (like double XP for an hour). A badge might be an achievement NFT that simply sits in your collection as a trophy (e.g. ‚ÄúSeason 1 Champion‚Äù badge NFT for the winner).
    - **Collectibles:** There could be fun collectibles ‚Äì perhaps each season has a theme and releases a set of collectible NFTs (trading cards, lore artifacts, etc.). Players can earn these through quests or loot boxes. They might have no in-game effect except bragging rights or trading value.


- **Partner Tokens:** Many Questano partners (factions) might sponsor quests with their own **fungible tokens** as rewards. For example, a DeFi project might reward users with some of its governance tokens for completing an educational quest. These tokens are real crypto assets that go into the user‚Äôs wallet. Questano integrates with such token drops (often via DripDropz for distribution, covered later). These partner tokens can often be used outside Questano (in the project‚Äôs dApp, for trading, etc.), so they blur the line between ‚Äúgame item‚Äù and real asset.

- **Merchandise and Codes:** Some rewards might be off-chain items or codes, like merchandise (T-shirts, discount coupons) or event tickets. While not digital assets, Questano can issue **NFT vouchers** that can be redeemed for physical goods. For instance, completing a big quest might give you an NFT that you trade in for a real hoodie of that project. This ties the community and physical world rewards together.

- **Item Utility:** Items can have various uses:

    - **Cosmetic:** Many NFTs (avatars, backgrounds, badges) are just for personalization and status. Users can show them off in their profile or maybe on a 3D avatar in the future.
    - **Power-ups:** Some items provide gameplay benefits. For example, a ‚ÄúQuest Scroll‚Äù NFT might allow you to complete a quest instantly or give you a hint for a puzzle quest.
    - **Quests Requisites:** Certain high-level quests might _require_ having a specific item. E.g., a quest chain might only unlock if you possess the ‚ÄúKey of Wisdom‚Äù NFT earned from a prior event ‚Äì making it exclusive and special.


- **Trading and Ownership:** All NFT items and tokens are owned by the players and live on the Cardano blockchain. This means players are free to trade them on marketplaces or transfer to others (unless certain NFTs are soulbound to prevent sale, but generally open trading is more fun). The economy thus has a **player-driven market** aspect: a rare title badge NFT earned by top 100 players might become a valuable collectors‚Äô item. Cardano‚Äôs NFT ecosystem supports this easily, and Questano-leveraged NFTs have the same transparency and provenance. _Blockchain games on Cardano like AdaQuest and Cardania also allow trading of their NFT cards and assets, illustrating the importance of true item ownership_ _._

- **Inventory System:** Questano provides an inventory dashboard where players can see all their items. From there, they can choose which avatar or badge to equip, use consumables, or link to marketplaces to trade. Inventory is basically reading what NFTs your wallet holds that are recognized as Questano items (plus partner tokens balances).

- **Item Acquisition:** How do you get items? Multiple ways:

    - Completing quests (some quests directly reward an item NFT or give a chance to drop one).
    - Crafting or exchanging: Perhaps collecting certain base items can be exchanged for a better item.
    - Seasonal rewards: Top players get unique NFT prizes.
    - Airdrops: Questano or partners might occasionally drop surprise NFTs to active players.  

The rich variety of items makes Questano more than just a points game; it‚Äôs also about **collection and strategy**. Players may strategize which items to pursue (maybe you want that NFT sword that boosts your quest rewards), and the platform can continuously introduce new items to keep the economy dynamic. All these economic components ‚Äì XP, Gold, Fame, Points, and Items ‚Äì interlock to create a vibrant **play-and-earn ecosystem** where every action has tangible outcomes.
