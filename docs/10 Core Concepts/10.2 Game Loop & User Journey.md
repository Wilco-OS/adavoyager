___
### **1. Onboarding (Free Mode vs. Wallet Mode)**

New players enter AdaVoyager via two modes:

- **Free Mode (No Wallet Required)**
    Guest access mode that offers a limited quest experience, ideal for newcomers. No wallet connection needed. Players can explore a small set of quests and learn game basics.
- **Full Mode (Wallet Connected)**
    Unlocks the full game experience by connecting a Cardano wallet. Upon connection, a unique [[NFT Avatar]] is minted, becoming the player’s in-game identity. Optionally, their [[ADAHandle]] is used as a display name (e.g. wilco.adahandle).

---

### **2. Activation (NFT Avatar Minting)**

Upon entering Full Mode:

- The system mints a **unique NFT Avatar** for the player.
- This avatar:
    - Represents the player’s profile visually.
    - May include visual traits, tiers, or perks.
    - Displays the player’s [[ADAHandle]] (if available) or a unique tag (e.g. Wilco#127).

- This avatar is central to profile progression and may tie into cosmetic or leaderboard features later on.

---

### **3. Choosing Participation – Guild or Solo**

After minting:

- Players decide whether to:
    - **Join a [[Guild]]** for community-driven gameplay.
    - **Remain solo**, focusing on global or [[Faction]] quests.
- Guild membership may require:
    - Application or invitation.
    - Seasonal exclusivity: players can switch only between seasons.
- Guilds unlock access to exclusive quests, rewards, and reputation mechanics.

---

### **4. Quest Engagement**

Quests are the core of AdaVoyager’s loop.

- Types include: [[Standard Quest]], [[QR Code Quest]], [[Quiz Quest]], [[Social Media Quest]], and more.
- Quest sources: [[Guild]], [[Faction]], [[Partner Special Quest]], or event-driven.
- First quests guide players through:
    - Setting up their profile.    
    - Earning initial rewards.    
    - Learning Cardano ecosystem concepts.    
- Rewards include [[Experience (XP)]], [[Gold (USDM)]], [[Fame]], [[Badges]], and other perks.

---

### **5. Progression & Leveling**

Players progress on two main axes:

- **XP (Experience)**
    - Permanent.    
    - Tied to account and avatar.    
    - Unlocks [[Tiers]], long-term perks, or prestige.    
- **Points**
    - Seasonal or weekly.    
    - Used in [[Leaderboards]] (User, Guild, Faction).    
    - Reset each new season to keep competition fresh.    

This dual system ensures both long-term progression and fair seasonal competition.

---

### **6. Guild and Faction Interaction**

- **Guild Quests**
    Benefit both the individual and the guild—contributing to [[Guild Reputation]] and [[Guild Leaderboard]] placement.
- **Faction Quests**
    Allow exploration and contribution to multiple partner projects. Players build [[Fame]] with each Faction even if they are not in the corresponding Guild.
- Players can only be part of **one Guild** per season, but can do **Faction Quests** for many different projects.

---

### **7. Seasonal Cycle**

AdaVoyager operates in **Seasons**:

- Each Season has:
    - Its own [[Season Start]] and [[Season End]].    
    - Unique quest sets.    
    - Leaderboards and ranking challenges.    
- At season’s end:
    - Points reset.    
    - Rewards are distributed.    
    - New quests and meta shift.    

Persistent values like [[XP]] and [[Fame]] carry across seasons.

---

### **8. Rewards & Transition**

At the end of a Season:

- Players and guilds:
    - View standings in [[Seasonal Leaderboard]]s.    
    - Claim rewards such as [[Gold (USDM)]], [[Partner Token]]s, [[Badges]], exclusive [[NFT]]s.    
- Rewards scale with performance.
- After claiming rewards, players move into the next season with:
    - Higher XP.    
    - Greater Fame.    
    - New avatar cosmetics or achievements.    
    - A clean slate of seasonal Points.    

This loop creates retention through resets while always building up a meaningful player identity tied to Cardano’s ecosystem.
