AdaVoyager runs in **Seasons**—time-limited periods (e.g. 4–8 weeks) where all activity resets competitively.

Each Season includes:
- A curated list of participating Guilds
- Thematic quests and events
- Point-based leaderboards for Users, Guilds, and Factions
- **USDM & token rewards** distributed based on performance
- Fame, XP, Badges carry over across seasons—Points reset

This ensures recurring engagement, fresh narratives, and fair competition.
