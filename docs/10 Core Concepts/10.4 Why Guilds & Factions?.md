- **Guilds** = Long-term alignment. Users pick one and represent it.
- **Factions** = Broad discovery. Users complete quests for all.

This dual structure ensures:
- A competitive layer (Guilds) with loyalty and season-based rewards
- An educational, open layer (Factions) that encourages broad ecosystem exploration

Every Guild is a Faction, but not every Faction is a Guild.
