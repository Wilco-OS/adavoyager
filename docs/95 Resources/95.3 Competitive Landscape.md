Overview of projects attempting similar goals:

- **Layer3.xyz** – Ethereum-based quest platform. Heavy on engagement, weak on ecosystem learning.
- **Galxe** – Popular for social tasks and reward campaigns. Not chain-specific.
- **Zealy (ex-Crew3)** – Community gamification via quests. Discord-centric.
- **Earn Alliance** – Web3 gaming hub focused on NFT games and quests.

**AdaVoyager Advantage:**
- Deep Cardano integration
- Real project education → not just engagement farming
- Reward loop directly tied to real on-chain DeFi mechanisms (USDM, LPs)
