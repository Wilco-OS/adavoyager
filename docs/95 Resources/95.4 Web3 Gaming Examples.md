Inspiration from successful Web3 game mechanics:

- **Illuvium** – Visual polish, tiered resource systems, staking
- **Stepn** – Dual-[[Token]] economy, daily mission loops
- **Pixelmon** – [[NFT]] identity layer, dynamic cosmetics
- **TreasureDAO** – Community-led questlines, economy loops across games
- **Sunflower Land** – Gradual progression mechanics, timed actions

Not copied directly, but ideas such as:
- Cosmetic unlocks
- Daily streaks
- Stamina/energy limits
- Time-gated content drops

...can be adapted for AdaVoyager’s Cardano-focused structure.
