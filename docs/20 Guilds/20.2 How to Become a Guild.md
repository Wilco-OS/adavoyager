To qualify as a Guild, a project must:
- Be an active, verifiable project on Cardano
- Launch a **USDM/ProjectToken Liquidity Pool** (via Sundae.fi)
- Commit to creating at least 5 project-specific quests
- Appoint a Guildmaster and optional moderators
- Undergo a lightweight onboarding and approval process

Guilds may be rotated between seasons. This creates exclusivity and game freshness.
