A Guild is a project-backed team users can pledge loyalty to during a season.  
Each user can only be part of **one Guild per season**, introducing strategic commitment and competition.

Guilds are:
- Represented by actual Cardano-based projects
- A central layer for season-based rivalry and alignment
- The only entities eligible for **seasonal USDM reward pools**

Being in a Guild unlocks exclusive quests, multipliers, and deeper game mechanics.
