A [[Guild]] is a project-backed team users can pledge loyalty to during a [[Season]].  
Each [[User]] can only be part of **one [[Guild]] per [[Season]]**, introducing strategic commitment and competition.

Guilds are:
- Represented by actual Cardano-based projects
- A central layer for [[Season]]-based rivalry and alignment
- The only entities eligible for **seasonal USDM reward pools**

Being in a [[Guild]] unlocks exclusive quests, multipliers, and deeper game mechanics.
