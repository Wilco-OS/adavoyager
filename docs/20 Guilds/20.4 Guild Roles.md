Each Guild can have:
- **Guildmaster**: The official representative (project lead or assigned person)
  - Creates and approves quests
  - Manages guild communications
  - Has access to guild stats and performance dashboards
- **Moderators**: Assist in managing quests and moderation
- **Members**: The general user base that joins the guild

Roles may impact multipliers or access to special features (e.g., bonus quests for mods).
