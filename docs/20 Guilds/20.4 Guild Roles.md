Each [[Guild]] can have:
- **[[Guildmaster]]**: The official representative ([[Project Lead]] or assigned person)
  - Creates and approves quests
  - Manages [[Guild]] communications
  - Has access to [[Guild]] stats and performance dashboards
- **Moderators**: Assist in managing quests and moderation
- **Members**: The general [[User]] base that joins the [[Guild]]

Roles may impact multipliers or access to special features (e.g., bonus quests for mods).
