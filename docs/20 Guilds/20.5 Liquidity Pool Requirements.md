Every [[Guild]] must back their status by launching a **USDM/ProjectToken LP**  
This ensures:
- Economic skin in the game
- Real utility for USDM
- Measurable alignment with AdaVoyager's mission

SundaeLabs (Sundae.fi) is a launch [[Partner]] for setting up these LPs.

[[Guild]] performance can influence future LP-based incentives.
