AdaVoyager embraces a clean, immersive UI inspired by:

- **Galactic and exploration themes** â€” maps, constellations, quest logs
- **Dark mode by default** with accent gradients (electric teal, deep violet)
- **Minimal navigation** focused on: Quests, Profile, Guild, Factions, Rewards
- **Gamified dashboard** showing daily streaks, seasonal progress, and quest queue
- Use of **card-based layouts** for content blocks (e.g., quests, partner campaigns)

Animations and transitions should remain subtle to preserve performance across devices.
