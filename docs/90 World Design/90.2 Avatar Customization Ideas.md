While not a 3D RPG, each player has a persistent Avatar (NFT-bound):

- Base character style with optional skin tones, clothes, themes
- Unlockable accessories via:
  - Quests
  - Badges
  - Seasonal rewards
  - Cosmetic Store
- Avatar appearance does not impact game performance â€” purely visual
- Optional integration with $adahandle and social profiles

Avatars offer identity, personality, and community recognition.
