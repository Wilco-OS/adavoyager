Events introduce dynamic changes to the UI and available content:

- **Thematic reskins** during active events (e.g., RareEvo theme)
- Event-specific tabs or layers (with countdowns and exclusive quests)
- Highlighted partnerships and sponsor quests
- Temporary tweaks:
  - XP multipliers
  - Special loot tables
  - Custom Fortune Wheel entries

The Event Layer creates spikes in engagement and serves as a monetizable entry point for sponsors.
