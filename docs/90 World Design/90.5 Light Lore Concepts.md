Optional lore elements to enrich immersion:

- Themed narrative around **“Voyagers” exploring the Cardano Galaxy**
- Guilds and Factions act as “stations” or “civilizations” in this universe
- Lore text tied to badges, seasonal events, and major partnerships
- Daily login bonus messages written in “Lore Style” (e.g., system transmissions)
- Doesn’t require deep worldbuilding — flavor text only

Lore can be toggled off for minimalists but creates a richer experience for power users.
