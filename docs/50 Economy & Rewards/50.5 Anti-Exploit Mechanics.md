To ensure fair gameplay and economic integrity:

- **[[Quest]] cooldowns** and daily limits prevent spam-farming.
- **Duplicate detection** on wallet, IP, and behavior pattern level.
- **Reputation system** flags users or partners with abuse indicators.
- **Manual moderation** available to revoke rewards or flag accounts if needed.
- **[[Leaderboard]] audits** run before seasonal rewards are finalized.

These checks maintain a balanced and abuse-resistant in-game economy.
