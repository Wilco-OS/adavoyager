[[DripDropz]] handles automated distribution of:

- **[[Gold]] (USDM) payouts** to connected wallets
- **[[Partner Token]] airdrops** as part of [[Quest]] rewards
- **[[NFT]] badges** for completing special challenges or milestones

[[DripDropz]] enables secure, verifiable reward claims directly on Cardano.

We can use DripDropz in two ways:
    1. **Quest Completion Airdrops:** After a quest, we provides DripDropz with a CSV of addresses and token amounts to distribute. Users then go to DripDropz (maybe via a link in AdaVoyager) to claim their tokens. 
       _Pro:_ offloads distribution and uses a proven system. 
       _Con:_ user has to take an extra step to claim (but many Cardano users are used to DripDropz).
    2. **Ongoing Rewards (Epoch-based):** For long-running contributions, a partner could set up a continuous Drip for AdaVoyager users. For example, if a user holds a AdaVoyager NFT or is part of something, they might get X tokens per epoch via DripDropz. This is more speculative.

- The integration likely involves AdaVoyager partnering with DripDropz or using their API.
    
- The benefit: **Secure, fair distribution** of partner tokens without AdaVoyager having to custody or individually send tokens to each user. This is both convenient and adds trust (since DripDropz is known as a neutral distributor ).
