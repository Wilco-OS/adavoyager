AdaVoyager operates with a tri-layered game economy:

- **Experience (XP)**  
  Tracks user progression, unlocks tiers, and affects multiplier bonuses.

- **Gold (USDM)**  
  Fungible currency rewarded for completing quests or winning events. Can be used for cosmetics, future upgrades, or in-game purchases. Backed by real stablecoins and distributed via LP logic.

- **Fame**  
  Non-transferable stat representing a user's knowledge and contribution to a specific faction. Builds social credibility and unlocks faction-based rewards or recognition.
