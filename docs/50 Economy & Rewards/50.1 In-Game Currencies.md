AdaVoyager operates with a tri-layered game economy:

- **Experience (XP)**  
  Tracks [[User]] progression, unlocks tiers, and affects multiplier bonuses.

- **[[Gold]] (USDM)**  
  Fungible currency rewarded for completing quests or winning events. Can be used for cosmetics, future upgrades, or in-game purchases. Backed by real stablecoins and distributed via LP logic.

- **[[Fame]]**  
  Non-transferable stat representing a [[User]]'s knowledge and contribution to a specific [[Faction]]. Builds social credibility and unlocks [[Faction]]-based rewards or recognition.
