Each completed quest has defined reward parameters, but overall economy management follows key principles:

- **Quest creators (Guilds, Factions, Partners)** define baseline rewards per quest type.
- **Seasonal limits** ensure gold is distributed within capped budgets.
- **Multipliers** apply based on streaks, difficulty, or user tier.
- **Leaderboards** determine bonus rewards at the end of each season.
