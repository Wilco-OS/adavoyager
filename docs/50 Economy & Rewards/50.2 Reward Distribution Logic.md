Each completed [[Quest]] has defined reward parameters, but overall economy management follows key principles:

- **[[Quest]] creators (Guilds, Factions, Partners)** define baseline rewards per [[Quest]] type.
- **Seasonal limits** ensure [[Gold]] is distributed within capped budgets.
- **Multipliers** apply based on streaks, difficulty, or [[User]] tier.
- **Leaderboards** determine bonus rewards at the end of each [[Season]].
