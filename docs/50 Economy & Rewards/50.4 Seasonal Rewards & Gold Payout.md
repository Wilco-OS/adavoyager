At the end of each season:

- **Top-performing guild(s)** receive a fixed USDM budget, allocated to their liquidity pool (e.g. via SundaeLabs).
- **User rewards** (Gold, Items, Fame) are distributed based on point rankings and milestones.
- Guilds and factions may also unlock **bonus quests**, **exclusive items**, or **cosmetic perks** for their members.
