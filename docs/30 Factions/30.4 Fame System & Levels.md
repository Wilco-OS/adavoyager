Fame is a measure of your **dedication and knowledge** about a Faction (project).

- Each completed Faction quest grants **Fame points**
- Fame is tracked **per Faction**
- Users gain **Fame Levels** (e.g., Novice → Expert → Master)

Benefits of Fame:
- Unlock special cosmetic rewards
- Show expertise and community affiliation

Future expansions could include access-gated content based on Fame Levels.
