Leaderboards exist to track top contributors for each Faction.

Types:
- **Faction Fame Leaderboard** (shows top users per project)
- **All-Faction Leaderboard** (aggregates total Fame across all projects)

Displays:
- Username & Fame Level
- Completed quests
- Time-based filters (All-time, Season, Weekly)

Leaderboards can foster competition, recognition, and community bonding around Cardano projects.
