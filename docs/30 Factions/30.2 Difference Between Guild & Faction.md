**Guild**
The competitive layer. Each player can join only one, forming loyalty and long-term alignment. Projects must meet certain criteria (e.g., liquidity pool, minimum quests, etc.) to become a guild. Guilds compete in seasonal rankings, with members earning collective rewards.

**Faction**
The educational & affinity layer. All projects can be factions. Users can interact with all factions, doing quests to earn Fame, learn about different projects, and display affiliation. Factions don’t require LPs or exclusivity. They’re designed to drive ecosystem exploration.
