A [[Faction]] is a project-based learning track that any [[User]] can interact with — regardless of their [[Guild]] affiliation.  
While Guilds are exclusive, Factions are **non-exclusive**: users can complete quests from all Factions to earn **[[Fame]]** and explore the broader Cardano ecosystem.

Key facts:
- Every [[Faction]] is backed by a Cardano project
- A project can be both a [[Guild]] and a [[Faction]] — or just a [[Faction]]
- Factions focus on education, discovery, and engagement
