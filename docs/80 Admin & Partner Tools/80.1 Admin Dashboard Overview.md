### **Admin Panel Features (Internal Team)**  

The internal team uses an admin dashboard to manage the platform:

- **User Management:** View and search user accounts, with ability to:
    - See user details (wallet address, username, level, roles).    
    - Impose penalties (flag, suspend, ban users) in case of cheating.    
    - Adjust balances or rewards in rare cases (e.g., compensate if a reward distribution failed, or remove points if found cheating).    
    - See user activity logs (quest completions, IP logs) for debugging issues or investigating abuse.    

- **Quest Management:** A central place to create, edit, or remove quests:
    - Create new quests manually or from templates. This includes setting up prerequisites, writing descriptions, adding images, etc.    
    - Schedule quests (set active time window).    
    - Attach rewards: points (auto), XP (auto), plus any Gold or item distribution. For Gold, the system will deduct from some reward pool; for items, ensure inventory exists; for tokens, coordinate with distribution system.    
    - Set validation logic: auto-validate (with predefined parameters, like check if wallet did X) or manual.    
    - Monitor quest progress: how many completed, how many pending approvals (for manual ones), etc.    
    - Retire or update quests if issues arise (e.g., if a quest is found to be buggy or abused, admins can disable it).    

- **Season Management:** Tools to configure seasonal parameters:
    - Start/end dates for seasons, weekly cycle settings.    
    - Reward tiers for the season (what rank gets what prize, or points thresholds for prizes). 
    - If using “season pass” concept, manage that – but here it’s more free vs NFT full.    
    - Reset mechanism that triggers at season end: archive old data, reset points, snapshot leaderboards to Hall of Fame.    

- **Economy Settings:** Control global economy parameters:
    - XP curve (XP needed per level).    
    - Point rewards scaling or multipliers (if an event double points week, admin can turn that on).    
    - Gold reward rates or caps for free accounts.    
    - Prices of items in Gold (if there’s an in-app shop).    
    - NFT minting settings (policy IDs, supply).    

- **Item/NFT Management:** Only if we issues our own NFTs or items:
    - Create item definitions (name, type, effect).    
    - Mint/burn items to users as needed. Possibly an interface to a minting service or to drop NFTs to addresses.    
    - Manage inventory of special rewards (like if there are only 100 of a certain NFT, track distribution).    

- **Guild & Faction Oversight:**
    - View all guilds, their membership, points. Admin can disband a guild if necessary (e.g., if full of bot accounts), or rename if issues.    
    - Approve guild logo uploads (to avoid inappropriate images).    
    - Faction management: approve new faction requests, edit faction info pages, assign partner admin accounts to factions.    

- **Partner (Faction) Admin Accounts:** The system allows creating admin accounts linked to specific factions, with limited rights:
    - A partner admin can only create/edit quests for their faction, view their faction’s analytics, and manage their faction’s reward distributions.    
    - They cannot see or change other factions or overall system settings.    
    - The internal team can impersonate or assist partner accounts if needed through the master admin.    

- **Analytics & Monitoring:**
    - Dashboard for active users, quest completion stats, engagement metrics (DAU, MAU, etc.), which quests are most popular.    
    - Leaderboard preview or tools to recompute if needed.    
    - Fraud detection dashboards: anomalies in completions, unusual account creation spikes, etc.    
    - Server health and logs if integrated (though devops might be separate).    

- **Integration Management:**
    - DripDropz integration interface: e.g., export list of winners for quest X in the format needed for DripDropz, or possibly trigger an API call to set up the drop.    
    - Webhooks management for external triggers (like if a partner’s system pings AdaVoyager when something happens).    
    - API keys for partners if they use AdaVoyager API (with scopes limited to their data).    

- **Content & Announcement:**
    - Post news or announcements that appear in the app (like “Season 4 begins June 1!”).    
    - Update wiki/documentation content easily for end users.    

- **Security & Roles (Internal):**
    - Not all internal admins have full power. Likely roles such as: Community Moderator (can ban users, approve quests but not change economy), Content Manager (can edit quests and content), SysAdmin (full access). The admin panel may show/hide sections based on role.    
    - Audit logs of admin actions for accountability (who banned who, who changed what quest reward, etc.).
