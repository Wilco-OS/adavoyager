Events (e.g., RareEvo) have dedicated layers in the system.

- Admins/partners can:
  - Create time-limited [[Quest]] sets
  - Issue [[Event]]-specific badges or cosmetics
  - Launch mini-leaderboards for [[Event]]-only rewards
- Integration options:
  - QR codes
  - [[Event]] check-ins
  - IRL partnerships (sponsors, booths)

Events can be monetized (via sponsor packages) or used as engagement spikes.
