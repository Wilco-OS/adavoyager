Guilds (projects with LPs and full integration) receive an extended dashboard.

- Manage roles ([[Guildmaster]], Moderators)
- Create **[[Guild]]-exclusive quests**
- Track [[Guild]] Points, [[Leaderboard]] rank, and [[User]] engagement
- Set reward incentives (badges, giveaways, etc.)
- View LP stats (USDM/[[Token]] pair health, volume)

[[Guild]] onboarding includes LP verification and [[Quest]] quality checks.

- **Partner (Faction) Admin Accounts:** The system allows creating admin accounts linked to specific factions, with limited rights:
    - A partner admin can only create/edit quests for their faction, view their faction’s analytics, and manage their faction’s reward distributions.    
    - They cannot see or change other factions or overall system settings.    
    - The internal team can impersonate or assist partner accounts if needed through the master admin.
