Guilds (projects with LPs and full integration) receive an extended dashboard.

- Manage roles (Guildmaster, Moderators)
- Create **Guild-exclusive quests**
- Track Guild Points, leaderboard rank, and user engagement
- Set reward incentives (badges, giveaways, etc.)
- View LP stats (USDM/token pair health, volume)

Guild onboarding includes LP verification and quest quality checks.
