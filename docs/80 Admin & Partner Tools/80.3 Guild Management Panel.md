Guilds (projects with LPs and full integration) receive an extended dashboard.

- Manage roles ([[Guildmaster]], Moderators)
- Create **[[Guild]]-exclusive quests**
- Track [[Guild]] Points, [[Leaderboard]] rank, and [[User]] engagement
- Set reward incentives (badges, giveaways, etc.)
- View LP stats (USDM/[[Token]] pair health, volume)

[[Guild]] onboarding includes LP verification and [[Quest]] quality checks.
