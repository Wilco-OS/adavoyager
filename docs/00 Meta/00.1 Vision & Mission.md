**Vision**  
AdaVoyager envisions a connected, vibrant, and gamified Cardano ecosystem where users, projects, and protocols engage daily in meaningful waysâ€”learning, growing, and earning together. We aim to transform Cardano into an adventure worth joining, not just a platform worth using.

**Mission**  
Our mission is to:

- Onboard new users into Cardano through an accessible, fun, and educational experience
- Strengthen the Cardano ecosystem by highlighting and empowering ecosystem projects
- Foster daily engagement, build [[User]] loyalty, and promote cross-project collaboration
- Support the growth of USDM adoption and liquidity through strategic game mechanics and reward flows

We do this by offering:

- A structured [[Quest]] system for real-world learning and action
- Gamified incentives to drive repeated participation
- Tools for projects to engage users directly and visibly

AdaVoyager is not "just another Web3 game." It is infrastructure to gamify Cardano itself.
