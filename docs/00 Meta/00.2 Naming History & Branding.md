**Naming History**  
The project was originally titled **MonetaHunt**, intended as a fun and explorative tool for events. However, the vision quickly expanded beyond events and Moneta. As the concept grew into an always-on, Cardano-wide engagement platform, we rebranded to **AdaVoyager**—a name that captures our core ethos:

- **Ada** represents the Cardano blockchain and its native ADA [[Token]]
- **Voyager** reflects exploration, journey, and discovery

Together, AdaVoyager means "one who journeys through Cardano."

**Brand Style**  
AdaVoyager blends a sleek, futuristic visual identity with a bold sense of adventure.

- **Primary Colors:**
    - Electric Teal: `#01D3DB`
    - Deep Navy: `#181447`
    - Hot Pink: `#FE00AA`
    - Midnight Blue: `#0D2862`
    - Moneta Mint: `#6CFBCE`
    - Royal Blue: `#1A56FF`
- **Tone:** Energetic, empowering, futuristic
- **Typography:** Modern sans-serif, tech-inspired but friendly
- **Visual Motifs:** Clean UI, holographic accents, digital explorer/space themes

The AdaVoyager brand is designed to feel premium, inclusive, and Cardano-native while leaving room for playful gamification and immersive UI features.

We'll aim for a sleek, dark-themed UI with glowing accents and occasional cosmic/mystical tones—echoing exploration, knowledge, and community.
