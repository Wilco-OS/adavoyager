## 8 June, 2025 First Brainstorming (Plex)

### **Quest & Balance Mechanics**

- Consider a system to **regulate the number and value of quests per guild** to ensure leaderboard fairness. Guilds should be able to create their own quests, but the total available points per guild should be balanced globally each season.
- Explore a mechanism to **separate quests by lifecycle**: New users should still be able to access “legacy” quests (e.g. intro quests for older factions or guilds), while seasonal competition is driven by newly introduced quests only.
### **Achievements & Recognition**

- Develop a **multi-tiered achievement system**:
    - **Guild achievements** (e.g. “Top Guild of Season 1”).    
    - **User achievements** tied to guild performance (e.g. “Member of Top Guild in Season 1”). 
- These should persist across seasons and be viewable via public profiles.

### **Leaderboards & Public Visibility**

- Plan to build a **public leaderboard system** (visible without login) that displays:
    - Top players, guilds, and factions.    
    - Archived results of past seasons.    
    - A persistent **profile directory or ‘arsenal’** (like WoW Armory) showcasing individual users, guilds, and faction histories.    

### **Faction Creation by Admins**

- Implement a model where **admins can pre-create passive Factions** representing major Cardano projects.
    - These Factions remain dormant until **claimed** by the project team.    
    - Passive Factions may still offer a set of starter quests curated by the game team.    
    - This ensures broader representation of the Cardano ecosystem from day one.    

### **Fairness & Anti Pay-to-Win**

- Strong stance: **No pay-to-win mechanics** allowed.
    - All quests must be accessible without financial obligation.    
    - No rewards should be locked behind forced token purchases or donations.    

### **Representing Project Relationships**

- Consider mechanics to **show alliances or relationships between projects**.
    - For example: visual indicators, shared quests, or joint events.    
    - Could introduce meta structures like “Project Alliances” or “Coalitions.”    

### **Ecosystem Categorization**

- Introduce **categories or tags for factions/projects**, such as:
    - “DeFi”, “RWA”, “AI”, “NFTs”, “Wallets”, “Governance”, “Infrastructure”, “Community”, etc.    
    - Could influence quest filters, badge types, or leaderboard segmentation.
