## 🚀 What is AdaVoyager?

**AdaVoyager** is not a classic RPG with avatars and open-world gameplay. It’s a structured, yet dynamic quest and reputation system that makes learning, exploring, and contributing to the Cardano ecosystem both fun and rewarding.

- Complete Quests  
- Earn Experience, Fame, Gold (USDM), and Badges  
- Join a Guild and support it in seasonal competitions  
- Help multiple Factions (Cardano Projects) to gain reputation  
- Collect rewards from Liquidity Pools and partner distributions  
- Climb leaderboards and unlock exclusive perks

---

## 🎮 Core Game Concepts

- **Guilds**: Choose one project-aligned Guild to support long-term. Guilds compete for seasonal rewards and receive liquidity boosts via USDM/token LPs.
- **Factions**: Every project in Cardano can be a Faction. Users can do quests for multiple Factions to earn *Fame*—a measure of their involvement with that project.
- **Quests**: Core gameplay loop. Can be informational (e.g. learn & test), interactive (e.g. QR scans at events), or social (e.g. post & engage on X).
- **Resources**:
  - 🟨 **[[Gold]]** = USDM (in-game currency)
  - 🟦 **[[Experience]]** = Progression indicator
  - 🟥 **[[Fame]]** = Project reputation metric
  - 🟩 **Items** = NFTs, partner tokens, cosmetics
