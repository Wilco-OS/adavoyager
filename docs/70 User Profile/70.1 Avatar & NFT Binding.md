Every [[User]] is represented by an **[[Avatar]]**, which can optionally be linked to an **[[NFT]]** (minted on Cardano) to personalize identity.

- [[Avatar]] NFTs may include visual traits, cosmetics, or [[On-Chain]] status
- Optionally linked to an **$adahandle** for vanity display
- Avatars can evolve (cosmetics, badges, [[Fame]] glow) with [[User]] progression
- [[Avatar]] = your public face across the AdaVoyager universe
