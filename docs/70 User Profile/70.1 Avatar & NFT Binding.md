Every user is represented by an **Avatar**, which can optionally be linked to an **NFT** (minted on Cardano) to personalize identity.

- Avatar NFTs may include visual traits, cosmetics, or on-chain status
- Optionally linked to an **$adahandle** for vanity display
- Avatars can evolve (cosmetics, badges, Fame glow) with user progression
- Avatar = your public face across the AdaVoyager universe
